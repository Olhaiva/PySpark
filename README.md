Movie & TV Dataset Processing with PySpark

This project demonstrates how to use PySpark for data preprocessing and filtering on a sample dataset of movies and TV shows, including information about authors and actors.

âœ¨ Key features:

Preprocessing and filtering of raw data before loading into Spark.

Example use of PySpark DataFrames for transformation and analysis.

Clean, reproducible workflow suitable for learning or as a starting point for larger projects.

Based on a simple educational dataset (movies + TV shows with metadata).

ðŸ“Œ Why this project?
The goal is to provide a clear and practical example of working with PySpark on structured data. It can be helpful for students, beginners in big data processing, or anyone who wants a quick reference project.

ðŸš€ How to use

Clone the repo.

Make sure you have PySpark installed.

Run the Python scripts to reproduce preprocessing and filtering.
